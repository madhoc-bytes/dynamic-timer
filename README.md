# dynamic timer
This timer help users stick to the 20-20-20 rule, which promotes eye health and digital wellness.

Upon the timer's completion (of the 'focus' time), the user will be prompted to lookaway for 20 secs.

The 'dynamic' nature of the timer is that it automatically pauses if the user is idle, and resumes when the user activity detected.

## settings
In the settings tab, users can customise the following:

**Focus Time** (min): the main timer countdown period

**Idle Time** (sec): how long the timer will wait before automatically pausing

**Look-away Time** (sec): how long each screen break will last

## inflight adjustments
Users can click on the `-` and `+` buttons to the left and right of the main timer while the timer is active to subtract and add 5 min from the remaining focus time while working
